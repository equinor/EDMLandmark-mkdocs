WHEREAS, Landmark and Oracle both desire that Landmark redistribute the
         Licensed Program into its application, subject to this end user
         license agreement ("EULA"),

THEREFORE, in order to facilitate your use of the Landmark Software and the
         Licensed Program, Landmark and Oracle give you this limited license
         to use the Licensed Programs, subject to the following terms and
         conditions:

2. No Technical Support. Neither Landmark, nor Oracle technical support
   organizations will provide technical support, phone support, or updates
   to you for the Licensed Program licensed under this Agreement.
	
3. Proprietary Protection and Restrictions.   Oracle shall have sole and
   exclusive ownership of all right, title, and interest in and to the
   Licensed Program (including ownership of all trade secrets and copyrights
   pertaining thereto), subject only to the rights and privileges expressly
   granted to you herein by Licensor. This Agreement does not provide you
   with title or ownership of the Licensed Program, but only a right of
   limited use. You must keep the Licensed Program free and clear of all
   claims, liens, and encumbrances.

     You may not use, copy, modify, or distribute the Licensed Program
   (electronically or otherwise), or any copy, adaptation, transcription, or
   merged portion thereof, except as expressly authorized by Licensor. You
   may not cause or permit reverse assemble, reverse compile, or otherwise
   translate the Licensed Program. You may not remove or modify any program
   markings or any copyright notice. You may not use the Licensed Program to
   provide third party training on the content and /or functionality of the
   Licensed Program, except for training of your licensed users. You may not
   disclose results of any Licensed Program benchmark. Your rights may not be
   transferred, leased, assigned, or sublicensed. You may not install the
   Licensed Program in any other computer system or use it at any other
   location without Licensor's express authorization obtained in advance
   (which will not be unreasonably withheld). If you use, copy, or modify the
   Licensed Program or if you transfer possession of any copy, adaptation,
   transcription, or merged portion of the Licensed Program to any other party
   in any way not expressly authorized by Licensor, your license is
   automatically terminated.

4. Limited Warranty and Limitation of Liability.   

     EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ANY
   AND ALL PROMISES, REPRESENTATIONS, AND WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE
   LICENSED PROGRAM; INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE OR NON INFRINGEMENT.

     The cumulative liability of Licensor or its suppliers to you for all
   claims relating to the Licensed Program and this Agreement, including any
   cause of action sounding in contract, tort, or strict liability, shall not
   exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000). This limitation of liability is
   intended to apply without regard to whether other provisions of this
   Agreement have been breached or have proven ineffective.
	
     In no event shall Licensor or its suppliers be liable for any loss of
   profits; revenue, data or data use, any incidental, special, exemplary,
   or consequential damages; or any claims or demands brought against you,
   even if Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such claims or
   demands. This limitation upon damages and claims is intended to apply
   without regard to whether other provisions of this Agreement have been
   breached or have proven ineffective.

     You may have additional rights under certain laws (e.g., consumer laws)
   that do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, or the exclusion
   or limitation of certain damages. If such laws apply, our exclusions or
   limitations do not apply to you.

5. Termination.  You may terminate this agreement by destroying all copies
   of the Licensed Program. Licensor has the right to terminate your right to
   use the Licensed Program if you fail to comply with any of the terms of
   this agreement, in which case you shall destroy all copies of the Licensed
   Program.
 
6. Export. You agree that U.S. export control laws and other applicable
   export and import laws govern your use of the Licensed Program, including
   technical data. You agree that neither the Licensed Program nor any direct
   product thereof will be exported, directly, or indirectly, in violation
   of these laws, or will be used for any purpose prohibited by these laws
   including, without limitation, nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons
   proliferation.

7. Open Source. "Open Source" software - software available without charge
   for use, modification and distribution - is often licensed under terms
   that require the user to make the user's modifications to the Open Source
   software or any software that the user 'combines' with the Open Source
   software freely available in source code form. If you use Open Source
   software in conjunction with the Licensed Program, you must ensure that
   your use does not: (i) create, or purport to create, obligations of us
   with respect to the Licensed Program; or (ii) grant, or purport to grant,
   to any third party any rights to or immunities under our intellectual
   property or proprietary rights in the Licensed Program. For example, you
   may not develop a software program using the Licensed Program and an
   Open Source program where such use results in a program file(s) that
   contains code from both the Licensed Program and the Open Source program
   (including without limitation libraries) if the Open Source program is
   licensed under a license that requires any "modifications" be made freely
   available. You also may not combine the Licensed Program with programs
   licensed under the GNU General Public License ("GPL") in any manner that
   could cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, the Licensed
   Program or any modifications thereto to become subject to the terms of the
   GPL.

8. Miscellaneous. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
   accordance with the laws of the State of Texas.

   The relationship between you and Landmark is that of licensee/licensor.
   Neither party will represent that it has any authority to assume or
   create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other party,
   nor to represent the other party as agent, employee, franchisee, or in
   any other capacity. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to limit
   either party's right to independently develop or distribute software that
   is functionally similar to the other party's products, so long as
   proprietary information of the other party is not included in such software.

   In the event that any of the terms of this Agreement is or becomes or is
   declared to be invalid or void by any court or tribunal of competent
   jurisdiction, such term or terms shall be null and void and shall be
   deemed severed from this Agreement and all the remaining terms of this
   Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

   THIS AGREEMENT IS THE COMPLETE AND EXCLUSIVE STATEMENT OF LICENSOR'S
   OBLIGATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES TO YOU AND SUPERSEDES ANY OTHER PROPOSAL,
   REPRESENTATION, OR OTHER COMMUNICATION BY OR ON BEHALF OF LICENSOR RELATING
   TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF.
